# Defining our workflows {.unnumbered}

We broadly define workflows as the tools, habits, and practices that we use to complete, collaborate on, and share our work. It can include how and when we like to send emails or the structure of documents we share with our coworkers. Our workflows will evolve with different projects, software, and collaborators, and defining it can be a process. The most important thing about your workflow is that it works for all involved!

**[Week 1 Huddle slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pCeddsph51ySX89z0DmIsZ_I40c4loO8bzTXOsf_9To/edit?usp=sharing)** provide a welcome and share examples for our first week together. We will spend time reflecting on our workflows so that in future weeks we can map out incremental and impactful ways improve your workflow, no matter where you're starting from.
